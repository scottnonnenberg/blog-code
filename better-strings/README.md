# Post: Better changelogs, strings, and paths

https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/better-changelogs-strings-and-paths/

These are the composable [tag functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals) you can use to start your own collection!

```bash
cd better-strings
npm install
npm run go
```

Enjoy!
