# Post: Notate: Better Javascript callstacks

https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/notate-better-javascript-callstacks/

This is a bit of test code you can use to try my [notate](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/notate) library.

```bash
cd notate
npm install
node 1_five_steps.js
node 2_five_steps_with_notate.js
node 3_five_steps_with_metadata.js
```

You may need to run these a couple times, because errors happen randomly.

Note the different information available to someone trying to debug each situation.

Enjoy!
